usage: tsv [options] [input-file]
         > csv-output

Options:
  +<start line>    Line (1-based) to start on. Default = 1.
  -t <tab width>   Specify the width of a tab character. Default = 8.
  --notabs         Use this if the input data contains no tab characters.
                   This increases performance by reading directly from the
                   input file instead of converting all tabs to spaces into a
                   temp file first. With this option, the input must be a
                   seekable stream.

Tab-separated values is how I'm going to refer to a simple file type for making
tables, where the starts of each column are aligned visually, with whitespace.

Example:

State       Capitol         Biggest City
Illinois    Springfield     Chicago
Washington  Olympia         Seattle
California  Sacramento      Los Angeles
New York    New York        New York
Louisiana   Baton Rouge     New Orleans

Even though some cells have internal white space, the columns are easily
identified because they're the only places where the whitespace vertically
lines up for the entirity of the table.

Note that "tab-separated" doesn't necessarily mean with literal tab characters. It can be space-separated as well.

This program takes a file with TSV data, and outputs CSV data, which is more
easily read by other programs.
