Tab-Separated Values (TSV) to Comma-Separated Values Converter

Tab-separated values is how I'm going to refer to a simple file type for making
tables, where the starts of each column are aligned visually, with whitespace.

Example:

State       Capitol         Biggest City
Illinois    Springfield     Chicago
Washington  Olympia         Seattle
California  Sacramento      Los Angeles
New York    New York        New York
Louisiana   Baton Rouge     New Orleans

Even though some cells have internal white space, the columns are easily
identified because they're the only places where the whitespace vertically
lines up for the entirity of the table.

Note that "tab-separated" doesn't mean with literal tab characters.
(In fact, in the current version, using tabs will mess it up.)

This program takes a file with TSV data, and outputs CSV data, which is more
easily read by other programs.
